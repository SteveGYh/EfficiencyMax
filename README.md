# Task_Table

# Basic idea: build a small, light weight time table that lists tasks information in a user friendly manner.

1.File storage:
All tasks information will be stored locally, using json or other customized structure.
Position of a task will be recorded using two coordinates: date and time, if no time is specified, then arrange position using priority.

2.UI demonstration:
